### Anything-of-anything

Our team is embarking on a new project titled **Anything-of-Anything** with the aim of pushing the boundaries of recent generalist AI models that are capable of handling a wide range of tasks. 
Our goal is to develop an AI model that can handle anything, regardless of its nature or complexity.
